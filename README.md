Look if the feature is already posted there. If not: click on New issue

Describe the feature you want as precisely as possible. Maybe with links to the addOn.

I'm the only developer on that project. So maybe it takes some time to add the feature. 

Please note that I am not a programmer. So I can note build new features by myself. I can add existing one like roaming bots. 
If you have nice Mods for the server you can also post it here. I'll check them as soon as possible.

Greetings :-)
